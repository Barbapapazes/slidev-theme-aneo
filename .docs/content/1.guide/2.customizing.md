# Customizing

_slidev-theme-aneo_ provide a lot of options to customize your presentation to fit your needs while remaining consistent and corporate.

## Title

The title of your presentation is the first thing your audience will see. It is important to make it look good.

To customize the title, you can use the `title` front-matter at the beginning of your `.md` slides.

```md[slides.md]
---
theme: aneo
title: My presentation
---
```

::alert{type="info"}
Title will also be used as the title of your presentation in the browser tab. More at Slidev [documentation](https://sli.dev/guide/syntax.html#front-matter-layouts).

## Author

You can also add an author to your presentation. It will be displayed at the center bottom of each content slide.

```md[slides.md]
---
theme: aneo
title: My presentation
author: John Doe
---
```

## Slides number

On each content slide, slide number will be displayed automatically. You can disable it by setting `disableSlidesNumber` to `true`.

```md[slides.md]
---
theme: aneo
title: My presentation
disableSlidesNumber: true
---
```

::alert{type="info"}
It's a good practice to have slides number on your presentation. It will help your audience to follow you.
