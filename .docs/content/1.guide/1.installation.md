# Installation

Prerequisites:

Because Slidev is based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

To install Node.js, you can follow the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then, verify your installation by running the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
v18.13.0 # or a more recent version. LTS is written on top of the download page.
```

Then, check that `npm`, the package manager of Node.js, is installed:

```bash
npm --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
8.19.3 # or a more recent version. Latest is written on top of the download page.
```

::alert{type="warning"}
On Linux, the default version of Node.js is too old. You need to install a newer version of Node.js.

## Create a new project

To create a new project, you can use the `create-slidev` CLI:

```bash
npm init slidev@latest
```

This will create a new project in the current directory.
