## Contributing

First, you need to install `pnpm` globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

_Pnpm is used instead of npm because it is faster and more reliable._ Learn more about [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

Then, you can run the following commands:

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run dev` to start theme preview of `example.md`
- Edit the `example.md` and style to see the changes
- `pnpm run export` to generate the preview PDF
- `pnpm run screenshot` to generate the preview PNG

Feel free to **open an issue** or **PR** if you have any questions or suggestions.
